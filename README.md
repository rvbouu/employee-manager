# Employee Manager

## Description

This Employee Manager command-line application allows users to add, view, delete, and update employees as well as the roles and departments of their business. It uses the inquirer and pg packages through Nodejs to run the application. The colors and console.table packages were also installed for use in the application for aesthetic purposes.
